Sudo version 0.20
=================

    Sudo runs commands as another user, provided the system sudo
    implementation is setup to enable this. This does not allow running
    applications securely, simply it allows the programmer to run a program
    as another user (suid) using the sudo tools rather than suidperl.
  
    This module specifically runs a single command to get output which is
    passed back to the user. The module does not currently allow for
    interactive bidirectional communication between the callee and caller.
    The module does not spool input into the callee.
